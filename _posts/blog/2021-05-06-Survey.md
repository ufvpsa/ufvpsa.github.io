Exams are over, summer is starting, and another academic year has come to a close! You made it through another year and your first (and hopefully last!) year of online learning. Congratulations!
We'd like to begin by welcoming next year's executive team. Please welcome back Annabelle Czihaly as President and Halen Davies as Vice President of Academic Affairs. Please welcome Catherine Laflamme as the Vice President of Social Affairs, Madisyn Taylor as Secretary, and last but not least, Jose Toffoli as Treasurer. We're all so excited for next year and we've already started planning! That's where we need some of your help... 
We at the PSA wanted to check-in with you and ask for some feedback so we can serve you better next year. Please fill out our survey located at https://forms.gle/vy6U5ZMPsG4tjxqY8 to give us some feedback on what you'd like to see from us next year.
We hope you all have a wonderful summer! 
Sincerely, Your 2020-2021 PSA Team
Annabelle Czihaly, Halen Davies, Kaitlyn Collantes, Garrett Paddon
