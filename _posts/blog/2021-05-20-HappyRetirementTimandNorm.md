Happy retirement Tim and Norm! We’re so thankful for all that you both have done for @goufv Physics and Engineering Physics 📚Tim, we’ll never forget your humour and wit. Learning mechanics from you was a treat! Norm, thank you for teaching us all about astronomy 🔭🌑 and for being the best lab instructor 🥼. We will miss you both and we hope you two can come back as sessional instructors. We wish you a happy and peaceful retirement. From UFV Physics 🔭📚🪐
