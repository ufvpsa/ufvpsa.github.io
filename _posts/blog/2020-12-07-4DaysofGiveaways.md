<b>What:</b> 4 Days of Giveaways

<b>When:</b> December 7-11, 2020

<b>Where:</b> Hosted via Instagram 

<b>Description:</b> Starting Monday December 7, we will be hosting the “4 Days of Giveaways”
Each day, we will feature a local business that we are supporting. To enter the contest, simply like the post, comment why you want to win a gift card for the specified business and tag your fellow UFV pals all within 1 comment (you may only enter each draw once). The next morning before the next post goes up, we will be randomly selecting a winner! The winner will be announced via Instagram post. You will receive your gift card virtually through student email (except for 1 gift card which will be delivered by mail!). T-minus 7 days until giveaway begins. Woohoo!!
