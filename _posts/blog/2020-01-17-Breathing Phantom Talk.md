<b>Date and Time:</b> Jan 17, 2020 from 4:00-5:30 pm in A353 on the Abbotsford Campus of UFV.

Do you like pizza? Are you interested in applications of physics? Come and listen to UFV alumni Brandon Vengenderen talk about Medical Physics, his projects, and applications of his degree/mechatronics diploma. There will be free pizza available for attendees!

Here is a taste of what the talk will be about:

About the Breathing Phantom System:

"This system is a medical device used in the quality assurance procedure for improving lung cancer radiotherapy. The lung motion during the inspiration cycle makes it very challenging for oncologists to treat the moving target lung tumor. The breathing phantom system simulates the motion of the target tumor in synch with the patientâ€™s breathing cycle. This means the radiation treatment can be delivered to the target tumor more precisely. UFV Mechatronics students designed the lung phantom vertical motion mechanism, and designed and programmed the main controller to synchronize the motion of lung phantom and target tumor, allowing for more accurate and effective treatment of lung tumours." 
This is a direct quote from <a href = "https://blogs.ufv.ca/blog/2017/09/applying-a-little-physics-mechatronics-option-adds-experiential-learning-to-science-program/">this blog</a>.

He will also be talking about what parts of his Physics/Engineering degree he's been able to apply to his career so far. And answer questions about it. He currently works as a Physics Assistant for BC Cancer Agency's Abbotsford Centre.
