The CAP is inviting applications for 8-12 seats on the very first CAP Student Advisory Council (SAC).  
The main role of the SAC is to represent the interests of all Canadian physics students by providing advice and counsel to the 
CAP Board of Directors on existing and new programs and support for physics students. 
</p>
<p>
The CAP is committed to building a vibrant and inclusive physics community in Canada. 
We welcome applications from students of all backgrounds and will make every effort to have representation from all
underrepresented groups in physics.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to be involved in the development of student activities and resources at the CAP,
please submit a brief resum√© by email to the Director of Student Affairs (Ben Newling, <a href="mailto:bnewling@unb.ca">bnewling@unb.ca</a>)
by the deadline noted below.
</p>
<p>
In your covering email please describe (in no more than 300 words) why you would like to be involved, and, 
if applicable: 
</p>
<p>
(1) initiatives that you would like to see advanced through a national physics association; 
</p>
<p>
(2) your previous involvement in promoting equity, diversity and inclusion in physics, and 
</p>
<p>
(3) your skills or points of view that you might bring to the Council table.
</p>
<p>
Applications will be accepted until 12 PM (Eastern time) April 8th 2019. Although SAC members must be either a 
student-affiliate or graduate-student member of the CAP, to join is free so do not hesitate to put your name
forward if you are interested but have not yet joined.

The first meeting of the Student Advisory Council will be held during the CAP Congress at Simon Fraser University (June 3-7 2019). 
The exact date, time and location will be listed on the Congress program.
